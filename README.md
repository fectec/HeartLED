# HeartLED PCB

<p align="justify">A collection of Valentine's Day themed PCB designs featuring LED animations in the shape of a heart. Perfect for pendants or keyrings!</p>

## Main Branch

<p align="justify">The main branch features a design built around the ICM7555 timer IC, configured in astable operation. The timer output drives a CD4017B decade counter, which sequences through LEDs to create an animated pattern. Power is supplied by a CR2032 battery through a TPS6122 boost converter.</p>

### Components Overview

#### ICM7555

<p align="justify">The ICM7555 is a CMOS RC timer providing significantly improved performance over the standard SE/NE 555/556 and 355 timers, while at the same time being direct replacements for those devices in most applications. Improved parameters include low supply current (60 Î¼A), wide operating supply voltage range (2V to 18V), higher frequency performance and no requirement to decouple Control Voltage for stable operation.</p>
